# Transit Northeast

## Overview
Transit Northeast is an application to allow users to effectively use public transit in areas where multiple transit agencies have jurisdiction. 

For example the current focus of this application is the Philadelphia metro area. This includes Southeastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and parts of Delaware. There are multiple transit agencies that operate in the region, SEPTA, NJ Transit, and PATCO being the main agencies. There is, however, a lack of consistent collaboration between agencies and it can be a real headache to transfer between agencies or when attempting to travel between metro areas, Philadelphia and NYC for instance.
This application aims to create a consistent way to visualize transit schedules and maps, and provide the ability to plan your travel using multiple agencies and to different metro areas.
